# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Scrimba Netflix clone - worked on getting the firebase username into the profile button. Worked on figuring out the "algorithm" for getting suggestions.

**Thoughts:** It's tough visualizing complex sequences of code when you can't always see the data. It has been really helpful to write it out on google docs.


### Day 1: June 13, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Finally got my "algorithm" working that gives me an array of users who have rated movies similarly to me and suggestions from that. Yay! This took me probably a week to visualize and type out.

**Thoughts**: It is very rewarding to finally figure something else out. If you are working with a lot of nested objects it can be difficult to keep where you are at in them clear

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
